They are south of the commercial street which regularly gets tour buses visiting the temple and graveyard of 孔子, or Confucius. Drunks sleep on that street. Their shouts, as well as the occasional drunk men looking for prostitutes, disturb Mother’s rest, but what usually wakes Mother up is Father drifting from the bed to ready himself for work. He would carefully fold open the sheet and tiptoe in his slippers to the bathroom, but would have to turn a light on to properly navigate it. That would almost always wake Mother up. If it was early in the morning she would close her eyes and pretend to be sleeping; if it was late enough in the morning she would get up and start her cooking.”\n\nYesterday Father retired.

She had fought not for glory, but to spare her father from death, yet each step she took deeper into war felt like a step away from the girl she once was. In the dead of night, she would lay awake, haunted by the faces of those she had killed, the weight of her father’s sword heavy in her hands. The shadow of destiny clung to her like a suffocating fog, reminding her that she could never turn back. Even as the soldiers praised her victories, her heart ached with the emptiness of a path chosen not for herself but for the sake of duty.\n\nAs the war dragged on, Mulan’s soul became hollow, consumed by the unrelenting burden of her sacrifice. She could not return to her old life, for the person she had been was gone, lost in the haze of battle. Her once-bright spirit was dimmed, replaced by the quiet sorrow of a destiny she never asked for. She had become a warrior and a hero, but in doing so, she had buried her own heart beneath layers of grief and guilt. When she finally returned home, there were no words that could erase the shadow that followed her—a shadow of a destiny that had claimed her future, leaving nothing behind but the ghost of the woman she could have been.\n\n#mulan #huamulan #wuxia #martialarts #instagram #martialarts #confucius #confucianism #sadness #loyalty #warrior","confucius, huamulan, warrior, mulan, wuxia, confucianism, loyalty, martialarts, instagram, sadness",

It laid the foundation for the country's rich intellectual and cultural heritage.\n\n🏫 Early Beginnings: Education in China dates back to the Xia Dynasty (2070-1600 BC), where formal schools were established to educate the sons of nobility. These early schools focused on teaching the ""Six Arts"": ritual, music, archery, chariot racing, calligraphy, and mathematics\n\n📜 Confucian Influence: The teachings of Confucius (551-479 BC) played a crucial role in shaping Chinese education. Confucianism emphasized moral integrity, respect for elders, and the importance of education for personal and societal development\n\n🎓 Imperial Examinations: During the Sui Dynasty (581-618 AD), the imperial examination system was established to select government officials based on merit rather than birthright. This system was further refined during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) and became a cornerstone of Chinese education for over a thousand years\n\n🏛️ State and Village Schools: By the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BC), schools were divided into state schools for the nobility and village schools for commoners. State schools offered higher education, while village schools provided basic education\n\n📖 Classical Texts: Students were required to study the ""Four Books"" and ""Five Classics,"" which included works like the Analects of Confucius and the Book of Rites. Mastery of these texts was essential for success in the imperial examinations\n\nChina's ancient education system not only promoted intellectual growth but also instilled values of duty, respect, and moral responsibility. Its legacy continues to influence modern education systems around the world.\n\n#AncientChina #EducationHistory #Confucianism #ImperialExaminations #CulturalHeritage","CulturalHeritage, AncientChina, Confucianism, EducationHistory, ImperialExaminations",

Is Common Sense Wisdom? Right, Wrong. Male, Female. Human, Animal. Black, White. Alive, Dead. The West seems confused, and the majority lack sensical thinking and intelligence. Glad some parts of the world still think and act logically. The Taipei Confucius Temple is modeled after the original Confucius Temple in Qufu, China. The ethical core of Confucianism is a strong belief in meritocracy and the Mandate of Heaven.  It promotes the behaviour of a superior person (君子 jūnzǐ), the Five Constants (五常 Wǔcháng – humaneness, righteousness, proper rite, knowledge and integrity) and The Four (四字 Sìzì– loyalty, filial piety, continence and righteousness). A Confucian should be honest, forgiving, neat, brave, kind-hearted, reverent, frugal and modest.  Confucius’ values of simplicity are echoed throughout the temples build to honour the Great Sage.  You pass through the simple gate and into the first courtyard area of the temple.  The front of the space is on your right as you enter and is dominated by the Wall of Supreme Knowledge (萬仞宮牆 Wàn Rèn Gōng Qiáng). This wall acts as a spirit screen and is emblazoned with a Chinese Unicorn (麒麟 qílín). This auspicious animal is said to appear before sages are born and, according to legend, one materialised before Confucius was born.  The wall itself is deeply symbolic.  It represents the profundity of the teachings of Confucius.  It shows that you cannot easily gain the knowledge and that you must strive hard to learn. ❤️🇹🇼🙏🏻#confucius #confucianism #temple #templesoftheworld #taipei #taiwan #history #architecture #art #taoism #buddhism #culture #confuciustemple #corporatemercenary #wisdom #explore #beautiful #love #travelblogger #travel #traveltheworld #fitfam #wanderlust #style #instatravel #travelgram #globetrotter #travelphotography #traveling #ninjaronz","confucius, art, corporatemercenary, culture, explore, traveltheworld, ninjaronz, taoism, buddhism, taipei, style, temple, traveling, wanderlust, history, instatravel, travelgram, taiwan, globetrotter, templesoftheworld, fitfam, wisdom, confuciustemple, confucianism, travel, travelphotography, travelblogger, architecture, love, beautiful",

Bell. I was stunned to read an Oxford-educated philosopher arguing that liberal democracy is not the only legitimate form of government. Being primarily educated in International Relations at this time, I was submersed in the Fukuyamist mindset that liberal democracy was humanity's final socio-political destination. To read someone persuasively rejecting that idea with calm and cultural sensitivity really opened my eyes to the potential of political theory applied to international politics. \n\nIn 2021, I was fortunate enough to have Bell as my thesis supervisor while I studied at Schwarzman College at Tsinghua University. \n\nFast forward to today, and Bell joins me on the Ideas Matter podcast as my first academic guest. \n\nGoing forward, I will be interviewing academics about their recent publications. This new format will help me release episodes more regularly. \n\nThe first episode with Daniel Bell is now live wherever you listen to podcasts. 🔗in bio \n\nWho else would you like to see interviewed on the podcast?

Some historians even suggest that he might have had affiliations with Islam, though this remains debated.\n\nOne notable piece of evidence is his poem titled ""Baizizan"" or ""One Hundred Words of Praise,"" dedicated to the Prophet Muhammad. Through the verses, Zhu expressed admiration for the Prophet and conveyed deeper messages of virtue, humanity, and spirituality. This poem acted as a bridge between the two great traditions of Islam and Confucianism, reflecting their coexistence in the cultural and moral fabric of Ming China.\n\n#MingDynasty #IslamInChina #Confucianism #CulturalHarmony #ZhuYuanzhang #HistoryOfIslam #MuslimHistory #IslamicPoetry #ChineseHistory #ProphetMuhammad #HistoricalConnections #WorldHistory","CulturalHarmony, ZhuYuanzhang, IslamicPoetry, ProphetMuhammad, Confucianism, IslamInChina, HistoricalConnections, WorldHistory, MuslimHistory, ChineseHistory, HistoryOfIslam, MingDynasty",

Confucius, himself, however, never actually lectured on queerness in any of his teachings.\n\nThe main reason Confucianism has developed over the millennia to take on a strong anti-LGBT+ stance is because Confucianism is heavily dependent on the structure of a heterosexual family so as to demarcate the rigid rules, obligations, and expecations of each gender and generation within the family. \n\nMoreover, one needed decendants in order to be venerated in the afterlife with offerings and prayers. Thus, queerness in Confucianism not only disrupted the socio-cultural hierarchy of a family/community but also made having children (whom you needed to sustain you in the afterlife) no longer guaranteed.\n\nIronically, though, very recently, Confucius' hard-conservative teachings on the family and family structure had been used in the U.S. Supreme Court's majority opinion in the legendary Obergefell v Hodges decision in 2015 that legalized same-sex marriage across the United States. Specifically, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, ""The centrality of marriage to the human condition makes it unsurprising that the institution has existed for millennia and across civilizations... Confucius taught that marriage lies at the foundation of government."". . .\n\n#Queermagicbook #Confucius #Confucianism #queer #lgbt #lgbtq #gay #china #gaychina #lgbtchina #lgbtqchina #queerchina #queerconfucianism #lgbtqconfucianism #lgbtconfucianism #gayconfucianism #legalism #family #queerhistory #gayhistory #lgbthistory #history #lgbtqhistory #ObergefellVHodges #Asia #ChineseHistory","lgbt, lgbthistory, gayconfucianism, Queermagicbook, queerchina, legalism, lgbtq, lgbtconfucianism, Confucius, lgbtqconfucianism, family, Confucianism, queer, ObergefellVHodges, history, queerhistory, lgbtchina, gay, queerconfucianism, ChineseHistory, gaychina, lgbtqhistory, Asia, gayhistory, lgbtqchina, china",

The I Ching was originally a divination manual and turned into a cosmological text with a series of philosophical commentaries known as the Ten Wings.\n\nAs a divination text, the I Ching is used for a Chinese form of cleromancy known as I Ching divination in which bundles of yarrow stalks are manipulated to produce sets of six apparently random numbers ranging from 6 to 9. Each of the 64 possible sets corresponds to a hexagram, which can be looked up in the I Ching. The hexagrams are arranged in an order known as the King Wen sequence. The interpretation of the readings found in the I Ching has been discussed and debated over the centuries. Many commentators have used the book symbolically, often to provide guidance for moral decision-making, as informed by Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. The hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance and been paralleled with many other traditional names for the processes of change such as yin and yang and Wu Xing.\n\nPart of the canonization of the text bound it to a set of ten commentaries called the Ten Wings. Arguably the most important of the Ten Wings is the Great Commentary (Dazhuan) or Xi ci, which dates to roughly 300 BC. The Great Commentary describes the I Ching as a microcosm of the universe and a symbolic description of the processes of change. By partaking in the spiritual experience of the I Ching, the Great Commentary states, the individual can understand the deeper patterns of the universe. The Great Commentary associates knowledge of the I Ching with the ability to “delight in Heaven and understand fate;” the sage who reads it will see cosmological patterns and not despair in mere material difficulties. Throughout the Ten Wings, there are passages that seem to purposefully increase the ambiguity of the base text, pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism.\n\nℹ️Wikipedia - “I Ching”\n\n#perennialism #iching #confucianism #confucius #religion #sacredtext #philosophy #divination #chineseclassics","perennialism, confucius, chineseclassics, sacredtext, religion, confucianism, philosophy, divination, iching",

It was first transcribed in the 6th-century ""Musical Records of Old and New"" by Guo Maoqian during the Song dynasty. \n\nThe ballad embodies key Confucian principles such as Xiao (family devotion) and loyalty (zhong). Confucius (551-479 BC) was a Chinese philosopher whose teachings on ethics and proper conduct, recorded in the ""Analects,"" have profoundly shaped Chinese culture and emphasized social harmony through respect and integrity. These values emphasize respect for family and duty to the state, which are central themes in Mulan’s decision to enlist in the army to protect her aging father. \n\nUNIVERSAL TRUTHS: Filial piety, a key Confucian value, highlights the deep respect and loyalty children owe to their parents and ancestors. Today, filial piety remains crucial in modern Chinese culture, often shown by caring for elderly parents and upholding family obligations. Within your own family, do you see filial piety as a core value? Are you prepared to make personal sacrifices to benefit your family members?\n\nOvercoming Gender barriers: The ballad illustrates that personal empowerment and heroism are not confined by gender. Similar themes appear in historical figures like Joan of Arc, who led French troops, and Deborah Sampson, who fought in the American Revolutionary War disguised as a man. The ballad of Mulan ultimately recognizes Mulan’s merit and contributions based on her abilities rather than her gender, advocating for the value of personal achievement and character over rigid gender stereotypes.\n\nGreek Gods and Heroes, our illustrated book with over 130 other full page illustrations, is coming in October to Kickstarter.

There we talked to the family head and walked around the Houses and a bit further to the Nakdong River that was right in front of the Houses. The Nakdong River (낙동강) is actually the longest river in Korea. The old Houses with the river in front and everything surrounded by mountains was probably one of the most beautiful places in Korea we have been to so far. The talk with the family head was interesting, since he is still holding up old family traditions. We were definitely able to feel how confucian traditions play a bigger role in Andong than it does in other parts of the country. Since I am also a Lee I was wondering if my father ever mentioned his surname origin. But Lino never said anything about his surname and neither did Felix, so we don't know which Lee-Clan they (and I) belong to. \n\nWe also went to the Korean Studies Institute in Andong to see the 550 preserved wooden plates that used to be hung up on traditional houses to show the purpose of the buildings or plates that were used for printing books. We even got to print our own sentence with carved wooden plates. \n\n#leebit #skzoo #leebitskzoo #andong #confucianism #nakdongriver #koreatravel","nakdongriver, confucianism, koreatravel, skzoo, leebitskzoo, leebit, andong",

We actually were there in May, but my friend never managed to post anything about our trip. \n\nOn the first day we went to a House Concert at the birthplace of one of the most important confucian scholars of Joseon Dynasty, Toegye Lee Hwang (1501-1570) (퇴계이황) (Toegye is his scholar name). He played a big part in developing and promoting Neo-confucianism in Korea. One of his most important achievements is the founding of the Dosan Seowon (도산서원), a confucian academy that trained scholars to pass the civil state exams (과거). The academy was very renowned since a lot of Lees students passed the incredibly difficult exams. \nToday you can find many roads that have his scholar name, but the easiest way to find him is to look on the 1000 won note.\n\nAlthough we are not a fan of Confucianism as a system itself, we were really excited to learn more about Confucianism, since it is such a big part of korean history. \n\nWe had a really great time in Andong. I will post another post for our Andong trip, but I probably cannot fit everything that we did in there so I just mention that we also visited a old village called Gunja (군자마을). The first picture is from there since I don't have one from the Academy (my friend was busy dressing up as a scholar and performing a greeting ceremony)\n\nOne of the professors who was on the trip with us saw my friend taking a picture of me and he also saw little Leebit dangling from my friends' bag. He thought that we are really cute and even asked to take a picture of little Leebit. That was a very proud father moment for me^^\n\n#leebit #skzoo #leebitskzoo #andong #confucianism #퇴계이황 #toegye\n#koreatravel","confucianism, koreatravel, toegye, skzoo, leebitskzoo, leebit, andong",

One of the key ideas involves the dualism of the soul, expressed through the terms hun (魂) and po (魄).Together, they represent the interconnected but distinct aspects of human existence, integrating both the spiritual and physical elements. This concept continues to influence cultural practices, religious beliefs, and philosophical thought to this day.\n\n▪️In Confucianism the concept ancestor worship though proper funeral practices and rites is often emphasized (the worship and respect for the ancestors through these rituals) can awaken their spirit so that they can bless their descendants with healthy and harmonious life.\n▪️Daoism went a step further dividing the human soul in Three Hun and Seven Po (often translated as Three souls and Seven spirits/senses 三魂七魄 sān hún qī pò). The three hun/souls are spiritual essence and the seven po/spirits are linked to one’s emotions. Through self-cultivation and spiritual practices one can achieve spiritual harmony and balance in life.\n\n☁️How did I even get the idea od exploring this or any other “unusual” aspect of Chinese culture? 💡Mostly it comes from learning the language. In this case I was writing a (very very) short plot summery of the Butterfly Lovers legend and I needed to use the word “soul”. I had a vague idea that the right word is linghun 灵魂, but just to be sure I went to look it up in the dictionary. And as you can imagine (if you’re learning Chinese you’ll know what I mean) the whole new world opened to me. I spent some time exploring it and now I’m sharing it with you. Hopefully you’ll find it as interesting as I do!\n\n📝If you’re learning Chinese language here is an interesting and useful idiom 魄散魂飞 (pòsàn-húnfēi be frightened out of one’s wits) Be frightened out of one’s wits \n\n➡️Swipe for more details about the key elements of hun and po and the Daoist view of this concept",,

For example, Taoists considered Confucians’ emphasis on ritual and social structures as unnatural. Mohists in turn believed that expensive rites and gradation of affection marked Confucian heritage as superficial. Legalists (most famous Qin Shi Huang, the first historical emperor of China) believed that Confucians’ interest in historical records and the culture of “courtly admonitions” could threaten the royal authority. Lastly, Buddhists associated Confucianism with extreme this-worldism. Finally, in modern era, China, Japan and Korea in particular have noted the general conservatism of Confucian heritage, viewing it as incompatible with social and technological growth and pointing it out as one of the primary factors for the former backwardness of (in particular) China and Korea. In more global contexts, Confucianism is frequently considered to be a deeply anthropocentric philosophy of men, advocating gender segregation and unconditional respect for elders and hierarchies.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#Confucianism #china #Buddhism #Taoism #Legalism #Metaphysics #Emperor #Conservatism #Mohism #Korea #anthropocentrism #hierarchy #segregation #opposition #criticism","Taoism, Metaphysics, Legalism, Confucianism, Conservatism, Mohism, hierarchy, anthropocentrism, Emperor, segregation, criticism, opposition, Korea, Buddhism, china",

Its influence spans across disciplines—shaping literature, art, medicine, cartography, and even the sciences. It has inspired endless commentaries from Confucian, Taoist, Buddhist, and even Christian scholars, each offering a unique interpretation of its timeless wisdom.\n\n📚 In the West, the I Ching has captivated minds for over three centuries, becoming the most recognized Chinese text since the 1950s. Its allure lies in its infinite possibilities—each consultation offering a new perspective, a new answer, a new path.\n\n🐉 The origins of the I Ching, one of the oldest texts in human history, are as mysterious as the wisdom it contains. According to ancient Chinese mythology, the culture hero Fu Xi - a being with the body of a dragon or snake and a human face - unlocked the secrets of the universe by observing the natural world. 🌿\n\n✨ Fu Xi studied the patterns in the sky and on earth: the markings on birds and animals, the movement of clouds, the arrangement of stars, and the textures of rocks. From these observations, he discovered that all things could be reduced to eight trigrams, each composed of three stacked lines, either solid or broken, symbolizing the interplay of yin and yang - the fundamental duality that drives the universe. ☯️\n\n🌍 The eight trigrams represent the forces of nature: \n☰ Qián (Heaven)\n☱ Duì (Lake) \n☲ Lí (Fire) \n☳ Zhèn (Thunder) \n☴ Xùn (Wind) \n☵ Kǎn (Water)\n☶ Gèn (Mountain)\n☷ Kūn (Earth) \n Together, they form the foundation of the I Ching, a text that has guided humanity through the cycles of change for millennia.\n\n#IChing #BookOfChanges #AncientWisdom #Taoism #Confucianism #Philosophy #SpiritualGuidance #TimelessWisdom #TaoApp","Philosophy, Taoism, TimelessWisdom, Confucianism, BookOfChanges, IChing, TaoApp, AncientWisdom, SpiritualGuidance",

In the video games and the latest version of the MK movie, both Liu Kang and Kung Lao died. Truth be told, idk why the director or the developers put that in the games and movie. After what I have learned about the Shaolin, they stand for truth and justice; fighting for the weak who can not protect themselves and for peace 🕊️☮️. They stand for the light of this world that shines through the darkness that’ll always take down evil. They have the hearts of a lion 🦁 and the soul of a true warrior, a soul that’ll never die or give up for the fight of justice.

As philosophies and religions, they not only influenced spirituality, but also government, science, the arts, and social structure. Though their specific beliefs and teachings have occasionally been at odds with each other, there has been much room for overlap. Instead of one tradition taking over and pushing the others out, three philosophies have influenced society alongside each other, changed each other, and at times blended together. Understanding unique interplay between these three traditions gives great insight into ancient Chinese society, as well as modern times.\n\nThough closer to a philosophy than a true religion, Confucianism was a way of life for ancient Chinese people, and it continues to influence Chinese culture today. The founder of Confucianism, named Confucius, lived from 551-479 BC. He was a philosopher and political figure who lived during a time when traditional Chinese principles began to deteriorate under competing political states. He took older religious precepts and translated them into guidelines for social mores. His teachings gave guidance on all levels of ancient Chinese life, from interactions between family members and in the public sphere, to educational standards and how states should be governed. Confucius saw every aspect of life as being made up of obligations between people and entities, and rituals to convey the mutual dependency between them. His teachings focused on humanism, including treating others the way you would want to be treated. He taught that if everyone fulfilled their roles and obligations with respect and kindness towards others, it would build a stronger state. While religious rituals were mentioned alongside all of other rituals a person was expected to perform, Confucius did not focus on spiritual concerns like the afterlife, gods and goddesses or mysticism. This is why Confucianism is considered a philosophy rather than a religion, even though it is often lumped in with other major religions.\n\n#china #archaeohistories #ancientchina #chinese #confucianism #historyfacts #chinesehistory #facts #taoism #buddhism","archaeohistories, buddhism, chinese, confucianism, facts, china, chinesehistory, historyfacts, ancientchina, taoism",

He was skilled in martial arts and the quest for immortality, holding several military positions. Yet, his true passion lay in spiritual enlightenment over worldly power.⁠\n⁠\nIn seclusion on Mount Luofu, Ge Hong wrote his masterpiece, Inner Chapters (Baopuzi), detailing paths to immortality through self-discipline, qi cultivation, and alchemy. He believed that true immortality required meditation, moral integrity, and understanding nature's secrets.⁠\n⁠\nGe Hong sought to harmonize Taoism and Confucianism, promoting moral purity and blending Confucian ethics with legal structures.

Despite Confucianism's social conservatism, though, Emperor Wu had several male lovers throught his life, but his strongest love was for a man named Han Yun.\n\nThey began a love affair together while both were still young, and upon ascension to emperor, Wu granted Han Yun undeserved prestigious titles and positions in government. The obvious favoritism caused much tension at court and made a hypocrite out of Wu who implemented the rule of promoting and bestowing rank based on academic excellence and skill instead of having the right connections. Ultimately, pressure from all sides forced Wu to mandate that Han Yu take his own life, ending the affair and his lover's undue place in government. . .\n\n #History #EmperorWu #HanDynasty #China #GayChina #QueerChina #LgbtChina #LgbtqChina #gay #queer #lgbt #lgbtq #queerhistory #ancientchina #chinesehistory #gayemperor #queeremperor #lgbtemperor #lgbtqemperor #gayhistory #lgbthistory #lgbtqhistory #confucianism #gayconfucianism #queerconfucianism #lgbtconfucianism #lgbtqconfucianism #HanYun #Wu #Zhongguo","lgbt, LgbtqChina, China, lgbthistory, chinesehistory, gayconfucianism, QueerChina, HanDynasty, lgbtq, LgbtChina, lgbtconfucianism, Zhongguo, ancientchina, gayemperor, GayChina, lgbtqconfucianism, lgbtemperor, queer, lgbtqemperor, EmperorWu, HanYun, queerhistory, gay, confucianism, queerconfucianism, Wu, History, lgbtqhistory, queeremperor, gayhistory",

However, true peace comes not from altering our external circumstances but from looking inward and facing ourselves.\n\nTo genuinely improve our lives, we must start by asking ourselves deep and probing questions. Who am I? What are my true values? What do I need to work on within myself to find inner peace?\n\nMaterial possessions and changes can never truly transform who we are. They might provide temporary relief, but lasting fulfilment comes from self-improvement and understanding. \n\nEmbrace the journey of facing your life exactly and completely, and you will discover a deeper, more profound peace.\n\nReflection Questions:\n* How do you face the challenges in your life?\n* What steps are you taking to understand yourself better?\n* Have you experienced a moment when looking inward provided more peace than external changes?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

Before you is a fairly recent piece, completed in 2005, but which pays homage to a rich history of art, literature, and philosophy. This is a calligraphic work based on the Heart Sutra, a text important to Confucianists, Buddhists, and Taoists. There are 38 columns out of timber, which are arranged in the shape of the figure eight, the infinity sign, and match the layout and the topography of the landscape with their careful arrangement. The highest column,not featured in my photo collection unfortunately, is blank, to reference the key concept of emptiness in the Sutra. \n\nThis wisdom path is near Ngong Ping of Lantau Island, close to the Big Buddha. The Heart Sutra is a concise work of just 260 words, and to see the beautiful calligraphy on the 8 x10 towering wood is a sight that is a must see for those who admire ancient texts, calligraphy, and beautiful nature. Close to Ngong Ping is also a fishing village called Tai O, which is over 200 years old, and many here keep to the traditional ways of life, lots of fishing market stalls, traditional street food, and houses on stilts. If you wish to be transported back in time, this is for sure worth combining with your visit to the wisdom path. There is also a cute cafe located next to an even cuter cat cafe which has some good books that are decorated with stickers, making for a super unique and atmospheric reading experience. Scroll through to see my postcards from Lantau Island, and this was my Day 2 in Hong Kong💗\n.\n.\n.\n#thewisdompath #lantauisland #ngongping #taio #hongkong #confucianism #buddhism #travel #foryou #photodump #postcards #asiatravel #literary #reader #bookworm #fyp","foryou, buddhism, ngongping, thewisdompath, asiatravel, bookworm, postcards, fyp, confucianism, lantauisland, travel, photodump, literary, taio, hongkong, reader",

Dating from the 9th to the 13th century, these rock carvings are celebrated for their grand scale, aesthetic excellence, and rich diversity of both secular and religious themes. They offer a glimpse into daily life and spiritual practices of ancient China, highlighting the harmonious coexistence of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism.\n\nOne remarkable cave at Dazu features statues of Confucius, the Three Pure Ones, and Shakyamuni. This unique combination showcases the blending of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, reflecting the philosophical and religious fusion that occurred in China over centuries. These carvings provide an example of how these three major schools of thought were harmoniously integrated into Chinese culture.\n\nThe Dazu Rock Carvings integrate scenes from everyday life into religious narratives. Noteworthy examples include the ""Transformation Tableau of Parents' Benevolence"" and the ""Transformation Tableau of the Great Requital of the Buddha."" Within the heritage site, you'll encounter elegant statues of Guanyin, serene Buddhas, respectful donor figures, lifelike depictions of drunken individuals, and intricately detailed incense burners. These carvings are a testament to the blending of various artistic influences and the skilled craftsmanship of their creators.\n\nPlan your visit to Dazu and step into a world where history, art, and spirituality come together in perfect harmony.\n\n#DazuRockCarvings #UNESCOHeritage #ChinaTravel #CaveArt #Buddhism #Taoism #Confucianism #CulturalHeritage #HistoricalArt #ExploreChina #AncientArt #TravelGoals #DiscoverAsia #SpiritualJourney\n\nPhoto by Aaron Greenwood on Unsplash\nJpbowen, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons","CaveArt, Taoism, CulturalHeritage, ChinaTravel, ExploreChina, UNESCOHeritage, TravelGoals, SpiritualJourney, Confucianism, AncientArt, DiscoverAsia, DazuRockCarvings, HistoricalArt, Buddhism",

All Chinese culture is based on the San Jiao. They are represented with the faces of their main exponents: Confucius, Buddha, Laozi.\n\nConfucianism is a school of thought that revolves around the thoughts of Confucius, with attention to morality, education, respect for ancestors and politics.\n\nBuddhism is a religious culture founded in India by Siddharta Gautama between the 6th and 5th centuries BC. The goal of the Buddhist spiritual path is to achieve complete liberation from suffering through spiritual practice.\n\nDaoism is a complex and ancient culture that developed in China and aims to follow the Dao, the universal principle of all things, an indeterminate entity that represents the continuous change of nature and its alternation between positive and negative phases.\n\n#sanjiao #threefaith #daoism #confucianism #buddhism","buddhism, sanjiao, confucianism, daoism, threefaith",

In particular, reliable data on Confucianism was even rarer. Marco Polo’s journeys were not only of dubious realism, but also took place within a time frame in which China was ruled by the Mongol Yuan, who largely did not represent native Chinese philosophical traditions. It was only at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century, when Matteo Ricci and his cooperating Jesuit priest-scholars delivered first translations of Chinese classics.

I think it has, and after a dramatic night of thunder, lightning, and the welcome respite of a steady downpour, the quiet aftermath of this morning is bathed in freshness.\n\nAnd this beautiful, quiet, metaphorically cobweb-free dawn was the perfect setting to do justice to *The Oxherd Boy*. Through the intricate yet delicate strokes of the Chinese Gongbi painting technique, the author goes along with a young farmer boy, his family ox, and a rabbit found in the garden, to give us a parable based on the three pillars of Chinese philosophy: Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.\n\nThe life-lessons sparsely gracing each page on love, family, community, the power of imagination and creativity, the innate need to have a kind heart in a world that is steadily growing more cynical with each day, dealing with pain, heartbreak, uncertainty, loss and its aftermath, and the quiet solace of just lending a willing ear rather than unsolicited advice are nuggets of wisdom as old as time.\n\nAnd yet, there is such a heartbreaking clarity in the wizened gaze of the smiling ox, the puckish charm of the can-do rabbit, and the philosophical observations of the solemn little boy, yet untouched by the ways of the world.\n\nI am a fool for exquisite illustrations, and this book awash in soft brush strokes and exquisite detail, coupled with those little familiar gems that we need to hear every now and then, will have a permanent place in my home library.\n\nOn days when I can’t understand people and their motives, on days when I can’t fathom myself and my hopes, my expectations, and my disappointments, I will return to this book….stroll languorously through a rice field with the boy, the ox, and the rabbit.\n\nAnd make peace with my demons.\n\n#books #bookstagram #instabook #bookreview #booklove #hardbound #chinese #gongbi #taoism #buddhism #confucianism #read #bibliophile #bookdragon #books2024 #love #instalove","bookreview, books2024, instabook, love, booklove, buddhism, instalove, read, hardbound, chinese, confucianism, bookdragon, books, bookstagram, bibliophile, gongbi, taoism",

He is regarded as the first teacher/educator of China, a model of wisdom and virtue, and his thinking founded Confucianism.\n\n• His teachings have been compiled by his disciples in the “Analects” (Lunyu 论语) and they emphasize on morality, sincerity, justice, wisdom, filial piety and social harmony.\n\n.\n.\n.\n#chine #china #chinadestinations #discoverchina #chinatravel #chinatrip #chinahistory #chinahighlights #chineseculture #chinese #pekin #beijing #beijingtrip #explorebeijing #confuciustemple #confuciantemple #confucianism #temple #culturetrip #culturalheritage #travelgram #travelblogger #blogvoyage #culturechinoise  #voyageenchine #worldplaces","chinatravel, blogvoyage, explorebeijing, culturetrip, chinahighlights, chinahistory, pekin, discoverchina, temple, beijing, voyageenchine, chineseculture, travelgram, culturechinoise, culturalheritage, confuciantemple, worldplaces, chinese, chine, confuciustemple, confucianism, travelblogger, beijingtrip, chinatrip, china, chinadestinations",

Originating around the 14th century BC, these ideas were first found on oracle bones used for divination in ancient China. Initially, yin represented night and darkness, while yang symbolised day and light. By the 3rd century BC, yin was associated with darkness and the north side of mountains, and yang with brightness and the south side.\n\nDuring the Han and Zhou Dynasties, the philosophical interpretations of yin and yang flourished, especially with the integration of qi, or vital energy. Philosophers like Confucius and Lao Tzu expanded on these ideas. Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching describes the creation and interdependence of all things through yin and yang, illustrating how these forces blend to produce harmony.\n\nYin is associated with darkness, nourishment, cool, dampness, Earth, Autumn, and Winter. Yang is linked to brightness, strength, dryness, heat, Heaven, Spring, and Summer. These opposing forces are in constant flux, each containing the seed of the other. \n\nIn Chinese medicine, yin and yang is utilised to categorise in various ways, whether it be the three treasures, body areas and depths, organs and pathogens. Maintaining a balance between yin and yang is key to sustaining harmonious health. Chinese medicine aims to achieve this balance, while also accepting that balance will always change into something else!\n\n#YinYang #ChineseMedicine #AncientWisdom #BalanceAndHarmony #Philosophy #Taoism #Confucianism #Qi #TraditionalMedicine #HealthAndWellness #HolisticHealth","Philosophy, Taoism, HealthAndWellness, Confucianism, ChineseMedicine, BalanceAndHarmony, HolisticHealth, Qi, YinYang, TraditionalMedicine, AncientWisdom",

Confucious believed that as beings had struggles and challenges in daily life that were unavoidable and necessary, kindness was a key element in maintaining happiness, balance, and stability in one’s community [as was respect]. It was particularly important during times of difficulty and stress as it helped give beings a feeling of being considered and cared for. When beings feel they are not appreciated or considered it creates frustration, resentment, and ultimately, imbalance, and is a cause for rebellion.\nPracticing kindness and respect was a stabilizing practice. In particular, Confucious encouraged and emphasized this practice for the government officials, the ruling class, and the privileged, as it showed respect for the ordinary people and kept the community happy, productive, and in-balance. These standards of behavior and responsibility were often sources of dispute and disagreement as they demanded equal accountability for both the poor and the privileged. This was radical, as the government officials and the privileged expected special treatment. (much like today). He believed all beings deserved equal opportunity, respect, and kindness and this was a natural birthright for all. If these elements are in place, it creates peace and happiness among the people and harmony ensues in the family, the community, and in the world. This was the whole point of living in virtue. It was a powerful practice that created a ripple of goodness and correctness from the small to the big and created harmony in the cosmos between Heaven and Earth.\nThe end goal was not as valuable as the process and the quality of the journey. Success was fine but appreciation for life was the key to happiness and satisfaction. If a being cultivated themselves with the virtues and was a lover of life and humanity without causing problems or imposing themselves upon the world of humans or nature, they were said to be “living” the Tao or following the Way. This was radical and revolutionary…and still is.\n#pathofspiritualboxing #kindness #radicalaccountability #the5virtues #Confucianism","radicalaccountability, kindness, the5virtues, Confucianism, pathofspiritualboxing",

It supports one’s effort with focus and careful attention and it illustrates commitment to one’s work and to one’s life. Diligence inspires persistent effort and encourages responsibility to complete tasks. When one is invested, diligent, and consistent, a sense of devotion and purpose develops, which in turn reinforces the strength of one’s convictions and beliefs. Just the simple act of consistent focus and attention increases one’s concentration and enables steadiness and greater productivity. The act of being diligent also creates healthy self-esteem and self-pride as it imbues good character and personal strength. Confucious felt that this was a very important element in pursuing education and developing new skills and it was a great example to others in the community as it showed dedication and a deeper sense of self-respect as it illustrated pride in one’s work. At that time, these qualities were essential for beings who wanted to be in government, public office, and administrative capacities as they were rigorously tested and had to pass exhausting examinations. Diligence also demonstrates a feeling of responsibility to be engaged and present in one’s life and mindful of one’s impact on the world. This creates trust and generates respect for those who live in virtue irrespective of their wealth, status, or position.\nThat was revolutionary... and still is.\n🙏\n#pathofspiritualboxing #the5virtues #Mentorship #Confucianism #diligence #characterexcellence #jedipath #spiritboxer #revolutionary","spiritboxer, the5virtues, Confucianism, Mentorship, characterexcellence, revolutionary, diligence, pathofspiritualboxing, jedipath",

This can be seen in passages like Isaiah 46:1-4, where God says He has carried His people from birth and will continue to carry and save them.\n\n2. **You feed your gods, our God feeds us**: This illustrates the idea that idols, being inanimate, require human intervention to be maintained, while the monotheistic God is the provider of all sustenance. Psalms 104:27-28 speaks of all creatures looking to God for their food, which He provides in due season.\n\n3. **Your gods are dead, our God lives**: This underscores the belief in a living God versus inanimate idols. Jeremiah 10:10-11 declares the Lord as the true and living God, in contrast to idols that will perish.\n\n4. **You made your god, our God made us**: This highlights the creator-creation relationship, as opposed to idols created by human hands. Genesis 1:27 asserts that God created humans in His own image.\n\n5. **Reference to 2 Samuel 6:6**: This passage refers to the incident where Uzzah touched the Ark of the Covenant to steady it and was struck dead. It illustrates that God does not need human help, as He is sovereign and omnipotent. Uzzah's death was a reminder of the holiness of God and the serious consequences of presuming to aid Him. \n\n#jesus #evangelistkas \n1. #Christianity\n2. #Islam\n3. #Hinduism\n4. #Buddhism\n5. #Sikhism\n6. #Judaism\n7. #Baha'i\n8. #Jainism\n9. #Shinto\n10. #Taoism\n11. #Zoroastrianism\n12. #Confucianism\n13. #Tenrikyo\n14. #Wicca\n15. #Rastafarianism\n16. #Animism\n17. #Paganism\n18. #Druze\n19. #CaoDai\n20. #Scientology","Sikhism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Wicca, Paganism, Jainism, Scientology, Druze, Baha, Judaism, Confucianism, Tenrikyo, Shinto, Animism, CaoDai, evangelistkas, Taoism, Rastafarianism, jesus",

This can be seen in passages like Isaiah 46:1-4, where God says He has carried His people from birth and will continue to carry and save them.\n\n2. **You feed your gods, our God feeds us**: This illustrates the idea that idols, being inanimate, require human intervention to be maintained, while the monotheistic God is the provider of all sustenance. Psalms 104:27-28 speaks of all creatures looking to God for their food, which He provides in due season.\n\n3. **Your gods are dead, our God lives**: This underscores the belief in a living God versus inanimate idols. Jeremiah 10:10-11 declares the Lord as the true and living God, in contrast to idols that will perish.\n\n4. **You made your god, our God made us**: This highlights the creator-creation relationship, as opposed to idols created by human hands. Genesis 1:27 asserts that God created humans in His own image.\n\n5. **Reference to 2 Samuel 6:6**: This passage refers to the incident where Uzzah touched the Ark of the Covenant to steady it and was struck dead. It illustrates that God does not need human help, as He is sovereign and omnipotent. Uzzah's death was a reminder of the holiness of God and the serious consequences of presuming to aid Him. \n\n#jesus #evangelistkas \n1. #Christianity\n2. #Islam\n3. #Hinduism\n4. #Buddhism\n5. #Sikhism\n6. #Judaism\n7. #Baha'i\n8. #Jainism\n9. #Shinto\n10. #Taoism\n11. #Zoroastrianism\n12. #Confucianism\n13. #Tenrikyo\n14. #Wicca\n15. #Rastafarianism\n16. #Animism\n17. #Paganism\n18. #Druze\n19. #CaoDai\n20. #Scientology","Sikhism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Wicca, Paganism, Jainism, Scientology, Druze, Baha, Judaism, Confucianism, Tenrikyo, Shinto, Animism, CaoDai, evangelistkas, Taoism, Rastafarianism, jesus",

Sono anche chiamati Padaung, che nella lingua autoctona significa ""collo lungo"". Nel 1990 a causa di un conflitto con il regime militare birmano, molte tribù si sono rifugiate nella vicina Thailandia. Da allora esse vivono con uno status legale incerto nei villaggi di confine, ma sopravvivono soprattutto grazie ai proventi derivati dal turismo, per via della tipica spirale di ottone che le donne Kayan indossano al collo fin dalla tenera età. Si stima che la popolazione kayana ammonti a circa settemila membri di ambo i sessi.\nIn Italia le donne della tribù Kayan sono conosciute con questo nome, dovuto alle modifiche fisiche provocate dalla caratteristica spirale di ottone indossata fin dall'infanzia, a partire dall'età di cinque anni. Crescendo, la spirale viene ciclicamente sostituita con altre di dimensioni sempre maggiori, fino a che la sua pressione esercitata sul corpo non provoca un progressivo slittamento della clavicola e una conseguente compressione della gabbia toracica. Pertanto, diversamente da quanto ritenuto, non è il collo a subire un allungamento, bensì le spalle a scendere. L'illusione ottica è creata dalla deformazione della clavicola, soprattutto nei soggetti più anziani, dove le spirali di ottone possono contare fino a venticinque anelli. Nessuna donna Kayan si priva di questa spirale ornamentale per tutta la propria esistenza, tranne in caso di adulterio. Una pena resa ancora più pesante laddove la donna, se privata della propria spirale, sarebbe costretta a vivere perennemente sdraiata come un'invalida, perchè gli anelli in ottone nel collo portano all'atrofizzazione delle vertebre cervicali al punto che la donna non sarebbe più in grado di reggere la testa se la collana viene tolta.\n\n#chiangrai #thailand #thailandtravel #thailandtrip #bangkokroyalpalace #royalpalacebangkok #confucianism #buddhism #buddhist #buddismo #temples #templesofthailand #bigbuddha #thailandgirl #chaingrai #karenlongneck #karenlongneckvillage #donnegiraffa #thailandgirls #thailandtourism #thai #thaigirls","karenlongneck, thailandtourism, templesofthailand, buddhist, thai, buddhism, donnegiraffa, temples, royalpalacebangkok, karenlongneckvillage, thaigirls, bigbuddha, thailandgirl, buddismo, thailand, bangkokroyalpalace, chaingrai, thailandgirls, confucianism, chiangrai, thailandtrip, thailandtravel",

To me personally most of the things that Confucius said seemed like common sense, but I had to really look at the contents of the book through the lens of the time it was written. It reminded me greatly of 'The Art of War' which is very good, but it's telling you, for the most part, very basic things. Things like 'prolonged wars are bad for the economy' or 'use supplies from your enemies so you can save your own supplies'. Now this seems very basic to me, and to many people in our day and age. However back in the time it was written this stuff was revolutionary and gave everyone an insight of how war works. I feel the same way about 'The Analects' it was groundbreaking and revolutionized China's culture at the time when it was written around 200 BC. It is an incredibly beautiful and helpful book that gives you clear paths of improvement and self satisfaction, but when I read it, it felt more like a reminder of all of these things than an introduction. I absolutely did adore this book, and I love books that are similar to it that offer these nuggets of wisdom, I just like to think about the implications these types of books have today then they did when they were originally written.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n#writer #writing #writings #writerscommunity #writinglife #wordcount #writers #writersblock #writersofinstagram #write #writersnetwork #writerslife #writingcommunity #read #reader #reading #readmorebooks #readinglist #readersgonnaread #readreadread #readmore #confucius #analects #confucianism #china #chinesebooks #ancient #philosophy #knowledge","confucius, writers, readmore, readinglist, chinesebooks, writings, writer, readersgonnaread, reading, knowledge, writinglife, write, writersnetwork, readmorebooks, writerslife, read, analects, writing, philosophy, writingcommunity, readreadread, writersblock, wordcount, ancient, confucianism, writersofinstagram, writerscommunity, china, reader",

The closest city is Datong, 64 kilometres (40 mi) to the northwest. Along with the Yungang Grottoes, the Hanging Temple is one of the main tourist attractions and historical sites in the Datong area.
